            <h1><i> <strong>MARKET OPENED ON A DULL NOTE – WHILE IN THE HOURLY HOUR MARKET RECOVERED MASSIVELY. INDEX TREND RESISTANCE ZONE </strong></i></h1>
<br>
<p>At bourse, we have witnessed extremely heavy buying pressure which recovered key benchmark index from the day low of&nbsp;44,389.68 to the high of the day&nbsp;45,952.45. Eventually market settled at&nbsp;45,682.77 with gains extended by 976.01 (2.18%) in a single day.</p>

<br>

<p>Top traded companies were TELE (55.047mn shares) followed by TRG (53.626mn shares), UNITY (26.430mn shares) and WTL (21.059mn shares).</p>

<p><strong class="strong">TECHNICAL STANCE&nbsp;</strong>– market immediate resistance hovering near 45,700 – 45,900 zone, however, most strongest resistance in our view near 46,000 – 46,300 zone. Today’s bulls attack on market would definitely build a buying momentum for couple of sessions&nbsp; where market was down in last three straight sessions. Therefore, investors/traders were eager to hunt any opportunity which they like most. Though all the big companies were added positive points OGDC, PPL, HUBC, TRG, LUCK, HBL &amp; PSO. These companies cumulatively added 499.09 points in a day.</p>
                <br>

                <h5><em>We have reviewed the most tradeable companies of “Pakistan Stock Exchange”.</em></h5>

                <p><strong class="strong">LUCK |</strong> trading at the verge of breakout from the current level therefore we would like to request you to watch this stock and if any kind of weakness observe then go for a short in intraday basis – any weakness will lead to decline till 850 – 852 zone while currently stock trading at 867.77 so alot of room to make money. Momentum quite strong at present level.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">TELE |</strong> formed strong bearish engulfing pattern on chart – therefore no fresh buying in coming sessions.</p>
                <br>

               <p><strong class="storng">TRG |</strong> has continued its bull rally. Today we observed a new high made by this company at 186.49 zone. Volumes front also lucrative as like everyone rushing to buy this company. Although we believe that it should accumulate on dips for a upside target near 215 – 219 with immediate stop loss below 165 (closing basis).</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">GGL |</strong> such like driving by unbreakable bulls. Stock has rallied more than 24% since Feb 2021. Currently trading at 37.63. Further upside likely to expect therefore you can make an entry till this stock is trading above 33.60 zone (closing basis).</p>

                <br>

               <p><strong class="strong">HASCOL |</strong> ONLY ACCUMULATION STRATEGY WOULD BE USED FOR THIS COMPANY. WE ARE EYEING THAT THIS GOING TO BOUNCE BACK SOON.</p>

                <br>

               <p><strong class="strong">ENGRO |</strong> this company seems good at current level go with long position and hold the stock for an upside of 320 while currently trading at 306.21. Use stop loss below 300 (closing basis).</p>

                <br>

               <p><strong class="strong">NETSOL</strong> | this company’s share price struggling to hold the ground above 148 – 150 zone. Today’s low 150.11 which is higher than preceding low of 149.12. This could be a sign of exhaustion of down trend. Therefore must watch this stock and use strict stop loss below 147 zone to avoid massive losses. On the contrary, if breaks below then we’ll see a downside upto 120 zone.</p>
