                <h3><i> <strong>This article reports the different sector analysis which help you to make a sound decision for upcoming week.</strong></i></h3>
                <br>

                <p><em><strong>We have reviewed the multiple sectors and their top companies which are highly tradeable.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

               
                <hr>
               <br>
              

                <h3 class="blue">OIL & GAS EXPLORATION COMPANIES (E&Ps)</h3>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">OGDC |</strong> keep an eye on this stock, its sustaining the level of 100 in past several days therefore we are considering strong support area. Pull-back likely to occur. Keep your strict stop loss below 98 closing basis.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">PPL |</strong> following the similar trend as OGDC, keep an eye on this stock and any strong move from the lower level of 85 – 86 zone would be good time to hunt and hold your long position at least for an upside gain 90 – 92 level. Keep your strict stop loss below 83.50 zone.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">POL |</strong> this stock shows a bearish outlook while temporary support near 370 if breaks then it will go down further otherwise short upside which makes a price of 380 – 382 level.</p>

               

                
                <hr>
                <br>
                <h3 class="blue">OIL & GAS MARKETING COMPANIES (OMCs)</h3>
                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">PSO |</strong> this stock having strong support near 222 – 224 zone. While recent decline with lower volumes having no significance. This stock in the consolidation phase – once consolidation completed then we can see a sharp move. Trading near support –&nbsp; bounce back highly expected.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">SNGP |</strong> despite the decline in the market in last couple of week – however stock remain in the range bound 38 – 42 zone. Therefore, we believe that its getting ready to fly. Go for a long position at market rate with keeping stop loss below 35.40 (closing basis).</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">HASCOL |</strong> go for a buying at current market rate and hold it tightly.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">SSGC |&nbsp;</strong>gradually accumulate this company and hold it tightly.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">SHEL |</strong> accumulate at current market level &amp; hold for next 6 – 1 year period.</p>

<hr>
<br>
<h3 class="blue">CEMENTS SECTOR</h3>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">LUCK |</strong> once again back to range of buying. If sustain the level of 800 then you can go for long position immediately – otherwise you need to wait till it tests the level of 780. While we believe it time to accumulate and hold your position.</p>

<br>

<p><strong class="strong">DGKC |</strong> key support area 114 – 115 where possible demand likely to occur. Therefore, mark this area and actively watch. If rebound from the said level then we can see good upside in this stock upto 125 – 128 zone. You can place your stop loss below 113 (closing basis).</p>

<br>

<p><strong class="strong">MLCF |</strong> good to watch and hunt the great opportunity to make good profit at current. Buying zone 42 – 43 level and hold for first upside 46.85 followed by 51.25 – 51.40 zone. However you can place your logical stop loss below 41.50 (closing basis).</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">FCCL |&nbsp;</strong>showed very good move therefore we believe hold your position into this stock and let the rally complete with upper level target around 25 – 25.70 level. Currently trading at 23.78 and you can use your stop loss below 22 (closing basis).</p>



<hr>
<br>
<h3 class="blue">ENGINEERING SECTOR</h3>

<br>
<p><strong class="strong">ISL |</strong> Key support area in range of 82 – 84 zone. If sustain then you can immediately enter into this stock otherwise just wait for downside near 76.50 – 77.50 zone where you can start buying.</p>

<br>
<p><strong class="strong">ASL&nbsp; |</strong> needs to close above 24.25 zone to bring more buying into this stock. Otherwise it will come down to 21.20 zone soon. If trades above from 24.25 then we can see upside resistance near 25.29 – 25.540 level which is channel resistance.</p>

<br>

<p><strong class="strong">ASTL |</strong> strong support near 39 zone &amp; temporary resistance near 42.78 level. Therefore, keep an eye on this stock while don’t get entered at current levels.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">MUGHAL |</strong> Hold this stock at current level 94.61. We believe that strong support level near 88 – 89 zone where from it would take a support (re-buying zone). Keep your stop loss below that upto your risk appetite.</p>



<hr>

<br>
<h3 class="blue">FERTIZLIER SECTOR</h3>
<br>

<p><strong class="strong">ENGRO |</strong> Don’t buy at current level.</p>
<br>

<p><strong class="strong">EFERT |</strong> go for it, buy at current market rate with strict stop loss below 60 (closing basis). Upside target is 67.</p>

<br>
<p><strong class="strong">FATIMA |</strong> avoid trading in FATIMA due to consolidation phase.</p>
<br>

<hr>

<br>
<h3 class="blue">TECHNOLOGY SECTOR</h3>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">TRG |</strong> strong support resides near 128 – 130 zone – which has to sustained otherwise once again we’ll see a lower level of 110 – 112 zone. However price-action level suggested that downside pressure about to end in this stock and re-gain momentum of buying once again. Therefore, keep an eye on this stock so you won’t miss any opportunity.</p>
<br>

<p><strong class="strong">NETSOL |</strong> last hope of survive of this stock near 165 – 168 zone – if sustains then it would be better otherwise it may likely to go down below 150 zone. Bearish Sentiments grab completely this stock and bulls are not enough so far to jack up the price.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">SYS |</strong> trading in the consolidation phase therefore won’t suggest to go long at current level 455.15 zone.</p>

<hr>
<br>
<h3 class="blue">OTHERS</h3>

<br>
<p><strong class="strong">UNITY |</strong> keep your stop loss below 27 (closing basis). In case of trading above then it would be on a safe side and rebound chances are highly likely.</p>
