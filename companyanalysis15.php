                <h2><i> <strong class="green">WEEKLY STRATEGY REPORT – Index Likely to Rebound and Upside Target 45,000</strong>
                    </i>
                </h2>
                <br>

                <p><i class="red">We believe that market will halt the downtrend and likely to push up index up-to our targeted
                        level.&nbsp;</i></p>
                <br>

                <p>Market showed a tremendous&nbsp; rebound on the last trading session where index jacked up by
                    1,008.32 (2.36%) with volumes up-to 170mn shares whereas overall market volumes remained at
                    442.522mn shares.</p>




                <br>
                <p>During the session index tested a low of&nbsp;42,779.76 and high&nbsp;43,986.18 respectively.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Top traded companies which were remained in limelight – UNITY (88.257mn shares) followed by TRG (38.841mn shares), JSCL (17.736mn shares), PRL (17.390mn shares) and TELE (16.917mn shares).</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">TECHNICAL STANCE |&nbsp;</strong>temporary resistance stands at 43,900 – 44,000 zone. That’s a slight hurdle as of now, once market broken this level and start trading above then there would not be any major resistance before 45,000 zone in our view. The way market rebounded last day – clearly signal that market took support and really to fly up. After massive decline – from 47,300 to 42,689 index lost -9.74% therefore rebound highly likely expected at this level. If you go through our previous report there we quoted that start accumulation in the market. Currently index is trading at 43,788.08 and possible support should be at 42,600 (closing basis – stoploss level).</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">PSO</strong> <strong>|</strong> its time to buy and hold the stock with stop loss below 215 (closing basis). Things are pretty normal on chart and showing bullish sentiments.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">HASCOL |&nbsp;</strong>accumulate more position at this level and hold tightly – this stock will a better return while take a bit time lets say,&nbsp;&nbsp;3 – 6 months period. If you have that holding capacity then you must try / take risk with this company.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">SHEL |&nbsp;</strong>Buy &amp; Hold strategy… from here it would fly massively while control on emotions are key catalyst for this company.</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">SNGP |</strong> already done it’s correction – though we believe it would consolidate in between 37 – 42 zone and then fly to 52 – 55 zone. However you may place your stop loss below 36 (closing basis).</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">ATRL |&nbsp;</strong>this stock has also strong support near 176 – 178 zone. Therefore keep an eye on this key level and in case of sustainability hold your long position tightly. Upside target would be 217 in next couple of week.

                <p><strong class="strong">NRL |&nbsp;</strong>candle showed a positive sign to end downside rally and start upside, however need confirmation by tomorrow. If candle close above from the level of 559 then we can say its a rebound and go long.</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">LUCK |&nbsp;</strong>technically rebound appeared on chart – have a closer eye on it. During downtrend price slashed too much therefore, possible recovery expected which lead the price towards 860 primarily. Therefore you can enter with market price OR accumulate gradually on dips with strict stop loss below 800 (closing basis).</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">DGKC |&nbsp;</strong>technically rebounded – though you may open long position and hold for a while to get price 132 – 134 level in couple of week. While you may place stop loss below 114.35 (to protect your capital from adverse move).</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">MLCF |&nbsp;</strong>follow the similar trend as DGKC – though you can expect a target of 47 primarily followed by 50. Keep your stop loss below 43 (closing basis).</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">FCCL |&nbsp;</strong>rebounded from the key support level – therefore, put this company on your radar and watch closely to hunt better opportunity. If sustain above 22 then you can get long entry and hold for a next 3 – 4 weeks to get a good amount of return. Expected price 25.</p>
                <br>
                <h2><span class="blue"><strong>FERTILIZER</strong></span></h2>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">EFERT |&nbsp;</strong>this company is a good hunt, however right now position slightly risk, therefore closing above 65 level would signal buy otherwise not.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">FATIMA</strong> | trading in the consolidation phase, don’t enter yet wait and watch.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">FFBL |&nbsp;</strong>indecisive candles formation on chart – showing a weak structure. Don’t jump and just wait for a right time and price.</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">TRG |&nbsp;</strong>TRG closed in slightly negative zone, the biggest thing is it closed below from yesterday closing price therefore, things still not yet cleared. Wait &amp; watch – once TRG crossed the level of 131 then you can get entry into it and hold tightly, otherwise good for trade (intraday) where you can gain minimum 2 rupees on your trade.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">NETSOL |&nbsp;</strong>long legged doji formation – showing indecisive behavior from market participants in this company. Sustaining above from 225.92 would trigger buy signal and hold tightly afterwards, whereas if breaks then you can expect a downside upto 202 primarily.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">SYS |&nbsp;</strong>Hold your long position Target would be 490.</p>
