Which is showing that entire gains were wiped out by the sellers. On technical chart, candle is not indicating bullish move likely to remain intact due to Market participants are not ready take more risk from the current level – where market can move in either way. In case that, index trade below 45,645 then you should place your stop loss below this level to avoid any miss trade due to urgency. As we heard about the outcome of FATF rating. Further, IMF is all set to ready $2bn loan in terms of extended funds facility (EFF). Although IMF impose restrictions as well which will dent on economy severely. We believe that “Sell on Strength” that’s a most wise able decision.</h2>
