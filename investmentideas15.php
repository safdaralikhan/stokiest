            <h1><i> <strong>Pakistan Stock Exchange, key benchmark index showed a positive move in the preceding day. This uptrend rally likely to continue – slightly resistance near 45,600 – 700 zone. </strong></i></h1>
<br>
<p>As we have seen the market rally (14-04-2021). Index was on buoyant note right after the opening bell. Major support to move the index were TRG which added 31.74 ppts standalone basis followed by FFC 19.16 ppts &amp; HBL 18.72 ppts.</p>

                <br>
                <p>INDEX SUPPORT LEVEL WOULD BE NEAR 44,800 (STRONG SUPPORT). WHEREAS RESISTANCE WOULD BE NEAR 45,600 – 800.</p>
<br>

<p>However, market needs volumes – although we know that share activity will remain dull throughout holy month of Ramzan, still index needs a strong push from the bottom with volumetric support which rejuvenate the buying spree into market with more aggression.</p>

                <h3><strong class="orange"> Trading Calls / Investment Ideas | 15th April 2021</strong></h3>
                <hr>

                <p><strong class="strong">NETSOL |</strong> good for the trading – it has potential to move much faster therefore, long position after market opening at market rate with expected upside level would be 190 – 192. Stop loss should be 178 (closing basis). Current level 183.94</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">NRSL |</strong> keep your eyes more closely on this stock. It has attempted to breakout the level of 14 (which is key level at present). Closing above 14 would be better for this stock and price move likely to bullish from there. Immediately upside (Target) level 17 – 18 with stop loss below 13.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">SNGP |</strong> likely to hit 44 level soon. Price action enough strong to push price up. Since we are observing this stock, we saw that rang in which its trading from 38 – 42 zone. Finally its testing the 42 that’s a key area to make a new rally after consolidation of last 10-weeks. Upside potential 54 would be ultimate level as of now.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">PSO |</strong> currently this stock is trading in the downtrend, while short trading opportunity may arise therefore, if its sustaining the level of 217 then you can get long entry and hold for a 5 – 6 rupees gains in 1 or 2 days period.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">MLCF |</strong> long entry can be a good decision after breaking the level of 47.44 – which as previous high. Stock has tested the support&nbsp; near 46 and rebounded. Therefore, we believe that it would start up rally after breaking the said area. You may place your stop loss below 46. While if you can take more risk then it would be good accumulate till its trading above 43 zone.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">DFML |</strong> good entry level near 5 – 5.50 zone where from we can see upside upto 6 rupees. Stock is highly risky though you should place your stop loss below 5 or as per your risk appetite. Since last June 2020 this stock hasn’t traded below 5.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">ATRL |</strong> good to buy at market rate and hold for upside open to 280 zone. However, you can gradual off-load your holding before 280 level. While current price-action with hefty volumes illustrating the story ahead. Keep your stop loss below 247 zone.</p>
