            <h1><i> <strong>Trading calls for 14th April 2021 – We have reviewed the most tradeable companies which provide opportunities on regular basis… </strong></i></h1>
<br>
<p>Market activity will get slower due to holy month of Ramadan – Therefore we would suggest don’t take extra risk at this moment. If market volatility gets lower then you won’t be able make profit from trading ONLY.</p>

                <br>
                <p>We will try our best to share good companies which can provide you a good amount of return by the time.</p>
<br>

<p>When it comes to the market – key benchmark index closed at 45,048.57 by gaining 70.52 (0.16%) points in a session. However market marked a high and low of&nbsp;45,133.41 &amp;&nbsp;44,780.06 respectively. Overall market volumes stood at 473.427 mn shares whereas KSE100 index shares clocked in at 183.852mn shares.</p>

<br>

<p>On technical grounds – market seems sustaining itself near 44,700 – 800 zone. Therefore, keep your stop loss below 44,700 any how otherwise market will get hurt and your positions will chock. As per history, market activity remains dull in entire month. Be careful while you are putting your fresh capital into any stock.</p>

                <h3><strong class="orange"> Trading Calls / Investment Idea | 14th April  2021</strong></h3>
                <hr>

                <p><strong class="strong">NETSOL |</strong> a good turning point observed in this company. Stock made a low of 152.55 and closed at 171.11 (at upper cap). Strong bullish sentiments in the late hours of trading witnessed. This rally likely to continue till 195 – 200 zone if closing come above form 175 (even if in the morning after 1 hour its trading above 175 then it would be a good sign for long entry). Keep your logical stop loss below 167 (closing basis).</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">FNEL |</strong> currently in the limelight – though if you are planning to jump into this stock then at least wait for closing above 13 which would be considered as safe-side entry level.</p>

                <br>

               <p><strong class="strong">HUMNL |</strong> building up momentum in the current situation. The trading range between 5.5 – 8.50 zone. At present stock trading at 6.60 – we believe that its an entry level with logical stop loss below 5.5 (closing basis).</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">GGL |</strong> tremendous rally formed – over the past one year. Since last March 2020 to till date produced roughly 338% of return. With respect to current rally we believe 33.50 – 34.60 would be a supply side zone. Overly aggressive momentum observed – which is not avoidable. Till bullish sentiments prevails this stock would perform while that sentiments will not last longer.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">EFERT |</strong> its turning back to 66 zone – in last two days it has surged by ~3% that shows investors are not bringing this company into attention. Keep your immediate resistance near 62.50 zone and get long position.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">SNGP |</strong> seems good while trading resistance for this stock near 42. Therefore, if it sustains above from the said area then you can hold tightly for next level 53 – 55 soon. Otherwise you can offload your position and re-buy near 38 zone.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">ASL |</strong> good to go at 26 – 28 zone soon. Its getting upward momentum. Currently trading at 24.92. Keep your stop loss below 22.50 zone closing basis.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">LUCK |</strong> don’t buy and stay away for a while till market gets settled.</p>
