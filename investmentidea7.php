            <h1><i> <strong>We have reviewed the most tradeable companies of “Pakistan Stock Exchange”.</strong></i></h1>
<br>
<p><i> As we predicted a bounce-back. Today’s key benchmark index witnessed huge upside rally with 856.49.</i></p>

                <br>
               <i><h2>Market skyrocketed after consecutive declined in last 4-sessions. Where index cumulatively lost near 1,500 points.</h2></i>
<br>

<h3>As we have predicted that market downtrend likely to end and start a upside rally. Today’s was the first day of this turnaround however, we need one more day and weekly closing on bullish note to conclude that YES this rally would be sustainable.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Important areas for market which are need to be in consideration while making any investment decision. Key support area near 43,500 and resistance zone 44,500 – 600 level. You can place your stop loss below the supporting point to secure your maximum gain and limit your loses.</h3>

                <h1><i> Trading Call / Investment Idea For | 07th April 2021</i></h1>
                <hr>

                <h3><strong>PIOC |</strong> 127 is the key level (profit-taking area). We suggest at least 50% profit should be realized and reminder would leave unrealize until stock decides its movement. Important support is 117. You may place stop loss below from said support area.</h3>
<br>
<h3><strong>HCAR |</strong> hold this stock – hopefully this stock will perform after 3 – 4 months period then it will also fly. The expected resistance near 300 – 303 zone.</h3>

                <br>

                <h3><strong>UNITY |</strong> expected resistance near 30 – 30.40 zone where you must be careful in holding position. Although momentum indicators are much aggressive however, over market impact would trigger sell-off in this stock. Fresh buying should be above from 30.50 (closing basis along with volumes).</h3>

                <br>

               <h3><strong>DGKC |</strong> good to hold the stock, even fresh buying above 121 would be beneficial for more 2 – 3 rupees gains. Expected target would be 125 – 127 by end of this week. Keep your stop loss below 118 (closing basis).</h3>

                <br>

                <h3><strong>ASTL |</strong> Market jump massively, however, this company didn’t perform. Therefore, we believe that until it closes above from 42 we won’t suggest a buy into this company. Currently “Sell on Strength” strategy would be implemented.</h3>

                <br>

                <h3><strong>ATRL |</strong> initial pull-back would be near 238 there you can take profit and sideline from the long position, we believe that it will complete its downside cycle and come down to near 190 – 200 zone although currently standing at 231 that’s roughly around 30 rupees decline.</h3>

                <br>

                <h3><strong>OGDC |</strong>&nbsp;Keep an eye on it. Current rate 100.55 while expected upside would be 115 – 117 zone. However, it will require nearly 2 – 3 week period. You may place your stop loss below 94 (closing basis)</h3>
