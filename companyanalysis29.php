                <br>


                <h3 class="blue">Technology Sector</h3>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">TRG |</strong> as we all know that TRG is one of the hottest item of our market in terms of trading. Currently trading at 166.65 (which is ever highest level – considerably). Volumes are consistently declining in last three sessions while price appreciation alongwith technical indicators are also showing slow momentum – therefore we believe that Book profit on strengths and re-buy near 150 – 152 zone.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">SYS |</strong> this company also showed a sluggish performance – Dullness will likely to continue in this stock. Therefore, don’t go for buying in upcoming week. Current price 457.23 and key support area near 430 – 435 zone where you can possibly think for buying given that rebound occur at the same level.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">NETSOL |</strong> hovering near key support area and bounce-back highly expected as per momentum formation on chart. Last several time stock showed strong rebound from the range of 225 – 230 and at present stock trading near 232 zone which is indicating that put this stock on your radar to watch closely. If breakthrough from 225 zone then we can see more downside 204 followed by 177 – 180 level.</p>




                <hr>
                <br>
                <h3 class="blue">Oil & Gas Exploration Sector</h3>
                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">OGDC |</strong> Sell on Strength strategy would be good for this company, as we can see pressure on Int’l oil prices due to 3rd wave of covid-19 slowdown economic activities – demand outlook remains weak therefore, prices are on declining trend yet our local players also facing the downtrend. Unless, breakout above from 106 – 108 zone with at least one day sustainability above from 106 zone will bring fresh buying into this stock, then you can also take a risk otherwise stay away.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">PPL |</strong> this stock also follow the same trend therefore, keep an eye on closing above 95 level to boost the buying spree into this stock and jack up prices outside the downtrend. CMP 90.22 | BUY ONLY ABOVE 95 – 97 ZONE.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">POL |</strong> trading near important support area 380 – 382 zone. If sustain this range then it would be good otherwise you can see a downside from here. Don’t buy with excitement let the price confirm the trend then enter with more aggression to make more handsome profit.</p>

                

                

                <hr>
                <br>
                <h3 class="blue">Oil & Gas Marketing Sector</h3>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">PSO |</strong> this company is one of the largest player of OMCs sector – though we never forget to analyze this company. The most immediate support for this stock is near 233 so keep this price in your mind before jumping. If trading level breakthrough from said area then you can just simply avoid the fresh buying into this company.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">HASCOL |</strong> on technical ground immediate resistance hovers around 11.60 – 11.70 zone – once broken this area would strengthen the position technically and push prices upward to 13.50 – 13.80 zone. However, downside support zone 10.50 – 10.70 zone.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">SNGP |&nbsp;</strong>company still unable to give breakout from the key resistance level near 41.60 zone. Keep an eye on it, once you finds the breakout then you can immediate go into long trade and hold your position for next 2 days, expected upside range would be 43 – 45 zone.</p>
                <br>
               



                <hr>
                <br>
                <h3 class="blue">Automobile Sector</h3>

                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">GHNI |</strong> the demand side getting weaker therefore, don’t get excited with any pull back which remains below from 272 zone. Trading below 272 as per closing basis will trigger sell on strength only.</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">PSMC |</strong> this stock showed a weak performance on last day of outgoing week. Therefore, we have incorporated that move into our analysis which is revealing the facts that most likely chances of decline compared to increase. Further, our statement would be true if stock sustain below 305 and give closing even below from 294 zone. Currently stock trading at 295.43.</p>

                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">SAZEW |</strong> after strong pull-back now momentum got weaker – though still chances for upside if market price abruptly move up from 188 zone otherwise we’ll see sluggish performance in upcoming week.</p>
                <br>
                



                <hr>

                <br>
                <h3 class="blue">Cements Sector</h3>
                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">LUCK |</strong> most likely downside will open to 790 – 795 zone in coming weak in case of price will remain below 850 – 853 level. Share price trading in the range which is reflecting a consolidation phase underway – therefore, either side of the trade would be riskier. Try to hunt opportunity at lower and higher levels instead of in middle.</p>
                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">DGKC |</strong> Strong support area near 117 – 120 zone. Keep in your mind that any buying should be planned near to support before that you can stuck your liquidity deliberately.</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">MLCF |</strong> immediate resistance near 47 – 48 zone if breaks then you can immediate get entered into the long trade otherwise stay away from the long position. Downside support near 43.20 – 43.50 zone.</p>
                <br>
