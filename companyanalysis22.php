                </h2>
                <br>

                <p>As we have seen that market rebounded from the bottom and closed in a positive territory with more
                    than 1,000 points in outgoing week. From there market may likely take bit pressure of rising
                    Covid_19 cases in across the Pakistan and things are on table for either
                    implement&nbsp;<em><strong class="strong">Smart Lockdown</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>once again to curb the
                    rising pressure on economy.</p>

               <h2><strong>Technical Stance</strong> <strong>|&nbsp;</strong>Market immediate support is hovering near 44,100 zone while resistance is just ahead at 45,000 (which is key level for momentum shift). Market holds the low level of 44,104 and rebounded however, that rebound was not sufficient enough for Bulls to control market – For bulls aggressive entry likely to expect after crossing the level of 45,600 (with sustainability). Volumes front quite good – consistent volumes generation keeps participation intact in market. In case of adverse move amid Covid-19 cases surging once again and market loose bullish momentum by breaking down the level of 42,500 that would not be good at all for market participants we can expect more downside on cards then, key benchmark index anyhow hold the level of 42,500 and you can place your logical stop loss near to that area.</h2>

<h1><strong class="blue">OIL &amp; GAS EXPLORATION</strong></h1>

                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">OGDC |</strong> you may expect a positive move if this stock sustain the level of 98 in coming week, ONLY then you can build your long position and wait for upside target of 115 – 117 zone. You should use stop loss below 98 (closing basis).</p>



                <br>

                <p><strong class="strong">POL |</strong>&nbsp;down side rejection observed on chart (weekly basis). Immediate resistance resides near 405 – 407 followed by 420. Risk can be taken at current level with stop loss below 378 level.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong class="strong">PPL |</strong> strong support would be near 83 – 84 zone. Keep your eyes on it so you don’t miss any opportunity to hunt. In case of rebound then you can expect an upside target near 102 – 104 zone. Your logical stop loss below 82 (closing basis).</p>

<hr>

<h1><strong><span class="blue">CEMENT</span></strong></h1>
<br>

<p><strong class="strong">LUCK |</strong> Don’t enter in this company since 22nd June 2020 this company is trading below its 5-Weeks moving average rate though downside likely to come. Furthermore, RSI indicator also showing a&nbsp;<strong class="strong">Sell on Strength</strong> instead of buying. Although LUCK always looks attractive while current levels are not justifying the price.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">DGKC |</strong> Currently stock is trading near 126 while downside support area near 116 – 117 which is 20-Weeks moving average price. If sustain then good for upside, whereas in case of breakout it will decline more sharply. Though you may set your stop loss below 114 – 115 (depending your risk appetite).</p>

<br>
<p><strong class="strong">MLCF |</strong> Weak performance on weekly chart – therefore won’t suggest to jump with long entry. Upside wick rejection indicating that bulls were not able to control market and bears kicking in for sell-off. Upcoming week will be rollover week so you can expect a normal pressure as well along with Covid-19 cases pressure. Current price is 45.90 downside support near 43.41 and immediate upside resistance 46.10 – 46.50 zone.</p>

<br>
<p><strong class="strong">PIOC |&nbsp;</strong>don’t buy this stock wait and watch. Fresh buying only when stock trading above from 136 zone.</p>

<br>
<p><strong class="strong">CHCC |&nbsp;</strong>same view with Cherat on Weekly chart where things are not much lucrative. Current price 167 while immediately 5-week moving average resistance 171.40 level and support 20-week moving average 151.42. Keep these level in your mind before trading.</p>
<hr>
<h1><strong><span class="blue">OIL &amp; GAS MARKETING</span></strong></h1>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">PSO |</strong> in last week PSO shot up and tested its 5-week moving average 235.22 zone. Now lets just wait for trading above 236 zone which signals to buy this stock and hold for upside 245 – 250 zone. Otherwise downside support 223.80 (key support level).</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">HASCOL |</strong> Hascol turned up while closed slightly below from its 5-week moving average rate of 10.54 zone. We believe in long term risk in this company – as you can see our previous report where we highlighted that you have to inject or accumulate position in this company, expected target would be near 20 – 23 zone within 1-year period.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">SHEL |&nbsp;</strong>if sustain 152 zone then it would be great item to hunt and hold for long-term rather than trading perspective. Our expected target would be 225 primarily while current price 163.75 zone.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">SNGP |</strong>&nbsp;Risk can be take at current level and hold the position for next 3 – 4 weeks period in order to maximize your return. Current price 39.25 you may place your stop loss below 35 (closing basis).</p>

<hr>

<h1><strong><span class="blue">Refinery</span></strong></h1>
<br>

<p><strong class="strong">ATRL |</strong> last week quite aggressive for ATRL and you can expect the next week too while you may keep your profit-taking target near 240 – 245 zone. While you can keep your strict stop loss below 219.58 – corridor of stop loss too short due to market volatility.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">PRL |</strong> same view on this company too as ATRL, however 1st resistance resides near 25.64 – 26 zone. Keep your stop loss below 23.25 zone.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">NRL |</strong> this stock will face a resistance at 590.86 zone therefore, if trade above then only you can hold the long position otherwise you have to book profit and stay away from the long position.</p>
<hr>

<h1><strong><span class="blue">Engineering</span></strong></h1>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">ISL |</strong> trading in a tight spot where support and resistance in range of 86.50 – 89.54 zone. If it crosses below 85 then selling pressure push down further this company.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">INIL |</strong> standing at very critical level – support is just near 204 while current price 206. In coming week, if price comes down to 204 then most probably it will further down to 183 zone where it finds a support.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">ASL |</strong> its not a good level to go for it, right now momentum indicators are quite high which needs to be adjusted soon. Current price level 24.51 (indecisive candle formation). Upside price rejection several time leads to eliminate bullish momentum. Downside support near 21.47 zone.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">MUGHAL |&nbsp;</strong>bearish trend likely to intact with this company. Current price 96.73 while downside support near 79.40 (weekly basis). Strong level to buy this company and hold it.</p>
<hr>
<h1><strong><span class="blue">Technology</span></strong></h1>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">TRG |</strong> Sell on Strength strategy must be implemented due to technical indicators are overheated and need adjustments. Current rate 140.96. Upside resistance near 150.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">NETSOL |</strong> Sell on Strength – Don’t carry your profit trades.</p>
<br>
<p><strong class="strong">SYS |</strong> resistance area near 511 – if crosses above and remains on higher level then we can think to buy this stock otherwise just stay away.</p>
