                <br>
                <h3>As we have seen that market showed continuous weakness and crawling down to 43,548.21 zone. KSE100
                    face dent of -752.74 points in today’s session.</h3>
                <br>

                <h3>We believe that market would rebound from 43,500 level and give closing above 43,700, if that’s the
                    case then you need to go long and hold your positions which will give you good amount of return in a
                    very short span of time.</h3>
                <br>

               <h3>Majority of the stocks were heavily corrected now, its time to rebound – if we look at the volume profile then things are bit clear to us. Declining market with lower volumes indicating just a panic sell-off rather than actual sell-off. Therefore, its time to gradually build your long position and hold tightly. Few items are quite risky however, very lucrative for future i.e. TRG, UNITY, LUCK, GHNI, SAZEW, FFL, LOTCHEM, DOL, DGKC, ISL, MLCF and FCCL.</h3>

                <br>
                <h3>These above mentioned items are looking attractive at current rates for long-term investment for next 3 – 5 years period – will provide you handsome amount of return.</h3>

                <hr>
                <br>

                <h3><strong>&nbsp;TRG |</strong> this stock has broken the strong support area near 130 – 132. Now these levels become resistance for this company. If it sustain above during the session then you can plan your long entry into it. Otherwise, just stay away for end of this week and let correction complete near 111 – 115 zone.</h3>
                <br>

                <h3><strong>LOTCHEM |</strong> losing momentum at current level, it needs to close above from 16.40 zone then bulls would remain active in this stock. If this stock sustain the area of 15.58 zone then we have hopes to keep our long positions else we’ll close and come on cash.</h3>

                <br>

                <h3><strong>LUCK |</strong> First support 795 and second support 780 – 785 zone. If sustain it would be great to go long otherwise wait for sustainability. Upside target would be 855 – 860 level on very sharp basis.</h3>

                <br>

                <h3><strong>ISL |</strong> momentum in this stock is down while price is consolidating, this is indicating that this stock has potential to go up and current bears are not dominating the trend. However, still immediate support near 78 zone. Hunt this opportunity at said level.</h3>

                <br>

                <h3><strong>BYCO |</strong> don’t go for buy OR build fresh position into this company.</h3>

                <br>

                <h3><strong>DSL |</strong> don’t think about this company, current it has performed so well in a downtrend market but that would be a dead-cut bounce only nothing else, there is no story behind this move except speculation. If you buy at 5.88 level then you would stuck your liquidity by your own hands.</h3>>

                <br>

                <h3><strong>GGL |</strong> would likely to come down near 20 zone therefore we won’t suggest you to buy this stock – as market sentiments gets bearish about this company therefore keep yourself away from it.</h3>


                <br>
                <h3><strong>UNITY |</strong> at any how, 25 shouldn’t break this stock to keep bulls intact. Once bears hold the ground then it will come back to a level of 15 – 17 zone within 2-months period. However you can place your logical stop loss below 23 (closing basis).</h3>
